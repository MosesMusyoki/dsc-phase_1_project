# Overview

My company is interested in purchasing airplanes for commercial and private use. My goal is to find the aircraft with the lowest risk for the company. My findings will derive insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to decide which aircraft to purchase. I will analyse the dataset provided to generate visualizations which will lead to good insights on what to consider when purchasing the aircraft.

## Business understanding

The task is to find the factors to consider to purchace an aircraft such that the risk to accidents is low.
